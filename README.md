# Microcontroller Lab Homeworks
Each folder contains two other folders:
* Question source code
* Simulation and execution of code on Proteus

## Content Summary

1. Input and Output 
    * Write a subroutine that turns all LEDs on and off 4 times (5.0 seconds apart)
    * Write a subroutine that moves a point of light on the LEDs for 3 seconds. (The movement of the point of light is visible)
    * Write a subroutine that displays port A changes on the LEDs.
    * Write a subroutine that shows the numbers 0 to 9 as a countdown on each 7-segment.
    * Write a subroutine that shows the three-digit number read from port A on 7-segment and decreases with an accuracy of 2.0 and a frequency of 100ms.
    * Write a subroutine that resets each of the digits shown on the 7-segment by pressing the push button (each key for one digit).
2. Subroutins
   * Write a subroutine that shows your name on the first line and the student number on the second line.
   * Write a subroutine that displays the following phrase transiently on the LCD (the movement speed is such that it can be seen and read.)\
            ***Phrase:** "Welcome to the online lab classes due to Corona disease."*
   * Write a subroutine that scans the keypad below and displays the compressed number on the LCD.\
     <img src='ReadmeFiles/keypad.png' width="100" height="100"></img>
   * Write a subroutine that displays the keypad using the external scan interval and the compressed number on the LCD.
   * Write a subroutine that receives the initial call of a system including speed, time, weight, and temperature from the keypad and displays it in the desired position. If the        received number is out of range, the letters *EE* are displayed and wait for the number to be corrected.

      *Speed: ?? (0-50r)*\
      *Time: ?? (0-99s)*\
      *Weight: ?? (0-99F)*\
      *Temp: ?? (20-80C)*
   * In the project, call the above paragraphs in order.
